# Introduction

## Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis is primarily used to develop models that provide descriptions for the given dataset.

## Time Series Forecasting
Forecasting involves taking models fit on historical data and then predicting future values. 

## Components of Time Series
1) Level - Baselines value for the series
2) Trend - Increasing/Decreasing behavior of series over time
3) Seasonality - Repeated patterns over time
4) Noise 

## Suggestions for Forecasting
+ Take as much data as possible for testing, tuning and improving model
+ Prefer short time predictions for higher accuracy
+ Improve forecasts by updating the data points
+ Check if data frequency is too high
+ Identify the outlier values and missing gaps in order to improve the model
